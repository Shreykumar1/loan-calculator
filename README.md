```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone https://github.com/Shreykumar1/loan-calculator.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd loan-calculator # Or the actual project directory name

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Set up your API Key
# You must register and obtain a free API key from ExchangeRate-API.
# Then, locate where YOUR_API_KEY is used in the app code (e.g., in a .env file or directly in a service file)
# and replace it with your actual key.

# Step 5: Start the development server.
npm run dev
```

## EMI Formula Used

The EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) is calculated using the standard formula:

\[EMI = \frac{P \times R \times (1+R)^N}{(1+R)^N â€“ 1}\]

Where:

-   `P` = Principal loan amount
-   `R` = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)
-   `N` = Loan duration in months

## Currency Conversion API

This app integrates with the free tier of the [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) to fetch live exchange rates.
